Managing personal finances effectively is essential for achieving financial stability and long-term goals. However, individuals often struggle to keep track of their expenses, maintain budgets, and stay on top of their financial goals due to lack of organization and visibility into their financial activities. Your task is to develop FinTrack, a web-based tool for personal finance management that empowers users to track expenses, create budgets, categorize spending, and set financial goals to take control of their financial health.
